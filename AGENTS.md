> **Purpose**: This file provides comprehensive guidance for AI agents (OpenAI Codex, Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, and others) working with the ISIS Chat codebase. It encodes our coding standards, development workflows, and architectural patterns to ensure consistent, high-quality contributions.

## Project Context

ISIS Chat is a **Solana-native AI chat SaaS platform** combining advanced AI/RAG capabilities with Web3 blockchain integration. This monorepo uses **Turborepo** for build orchestration, **Bun** as the package manager, and follows a modular architecture with strict TypeScript and quality standards.

bun install
bun dev:setup  # Configure Convex backend

# Development
bun dev         # Start all services (web on :3001, backend)
bun dev:web     # Frontend only
bun dev:server  # Backend only

# Code Quality (MUST pass before commits)
bun check       # Biome format and lint
bun check-types # TypeScript validation

# Build
bun build       # Production build for all apps

# Testing (when implemented)
# bun test       # Run all tests
# bun test:unit  # Unit tests only
# bun test:e2e   # E2E tests
```

### Pre-commit Requirements

**NEVER use `--no-verify` flag**. All commits must pass:
1. `bun check` - Code formatting and linting
2. `bun check-types` - TypeScript validation
3. Commit message format validation

### Key Files to Understand

- `packages/backend/convex/schema.ts` - Database schema (source of truth)
- `apps/web/src/app/layout.tsx` - Root application layout
- `apps/web/src/components/providers.tsx` - Global providers
- `.cursor/rules/main.mdc` - Primary development guidelines

## Coding Conventions

### TypeScript Standards

```typescript
// ALWAYS use strict mode - NO 'any' types
interface UserData {  // Prefer interfaces for object shapes
  id: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Use Result pattern for fallible operations
type Result<T, E = Error> = 
  | { ok: true; value: T }
  | { ok: false; error: E };

// Implement proper error handling
async function fetchUser(id: string): Promise<Result<UserData>> {
  try {
    const user = await api.getUser(id);
    return { ok: true, value: user };
  } catch (error) {
    return { ok: false, error };
  }
}
```

### React Component Patterns

```typescript
// Server Components (default) - for data fetching
export default async function UserList() {
  const users = await getUsers(); // Direct async data fetching
  return <UserListClient users={users} />;
}

// Client Components - ONLY for interactivity
"use client";
export function UserListClient({ users }: Props) {
  const [selected, setSelected] = useState<string>();
  // Interactive logic here
}
```

### Convex Backend Patterns

```typescript
// In packages/backend/convex/users.ts
import { v } from "convex/values";
import { mutation, query } from "./_generated/server";

// Type-safe queries
export const getUser = query({
  args: { id: v.id("users") },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    return await ctx.db.get(args.id);
  },
});

// Type-safe mutations
export const createUser = mutation({
  args: { 
    name: v.string(),
    email: v.string() 
  },
  handler: async (ctx, args) => {
    // Validation with Zod
    const validated = userSchema.parse(args);
    return await ctx.db.insert("users", validated);
  },
});
```

### Import Organization

```typescript
// 1. External packages
import { useState } from "react";
import { z } from "zod";

// 2. Internal packages
import { api } from "@isis-chat/backend";

// 3. Local imports
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button";
import { validateInput } from "@/lib/utils";
```

## Testing Instructions

### Test Execution Commands

```bash
# Run all tests before submitting PR
bun test                    # All tests
bun test:unit              # Unit tests only
bun test:integration       # Integration tests
bun test:e2e               # End-to-end tests

# Coverage requirements
# - Unit: 90%+ statements, 85%+ branches
# - Integration: All API endpoints
# - E2E: Critical user paths
```

### Writing Tests

```typescript
// Unit test example (when implemented)
describe("UserService", () => {
  it("should validate user input", async () => {
    const result = await validateUser({ name: "", email: "invalid" });
    expect(result.ok).toBe(false);
    expect(result.error).toMatch(/validation/);
  });
});
```

## AI-Specific Guidelines

### AI/RAG Integration Patterns

The project is designed for multi-model AI with RAG capabilities:

```typescript
// AI service initialization (planned implementation)
const aiService = new AIService({
  models: ['claude-3.5-sonnet', 'gpt-4o', 'deepseek-v3'],
  vectorDb: qdrantClient,
  streaming: true,
  fallbackChain: true
});

// Vector search configuration
const vectorSearch = new VectorSearchService({
  collection: 'isis_knowledge_base',
  searchType: 'hybrid', // semantic + keyword
  retrievalStrategy: 'contextual'
});
```

### Performance Requirements

- **AI Response**: <2s time-to-first-token
- **Vector Search**: <100ms query time
- **Frontend Load**: <3s on 3G networks
- **API Endpoints**: <200ms average response

## PR Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

```bash
# Required format (enforced by tooling)
feat: Add user authentication
fix: Resolve memory leak in chat component
docs: Update API documentation
refactor: Simplify vector search logic

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. **Define schema** in `packages/backend/convex/schema.ts`
2. **Create backend functions** in `packages/backend/convex/`
3. **Implement UI components** in `apps/web/src/components/`
4. **Add routing** in `apps/web/src/app/`
5. **Write tests** for all new code
6. **Update documentation** as needed

### Modifying Database Schema

```bash
# 1. Update schema in packages/backend/convex/schema.ts
# 2. Backend will auto-reload and validate
# 3. Update TypeScript types will be auto-generated
# 4. Update related queries/mutations
```

### Adding a New Package

```bash
# From root directory
bun add [package-name]           # Add to root
cd apps/web && bun add [package] # Add to specific workspace
```

### Debugging Common Issues

```bash
# TypeScript errors
bun check-types                  # Check all types
cd apps/web && npx tsc --noEmit  # Check specific app

# Convex connection issues
cd packages/backend && bun dev:setup  # Reconfigure Convex

# Build failures
rm -rf node_modules bun.lockb    # Clear dependencies
bun install                       # Reinstall
```

## Environment Variables

### Required Variables

```bash
# .env.local (apps/web)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=         # From Convex dashboard

# .env (packages/backend)
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=               # Convex deployment ID
```

### AI Service Variables (Future)

```bash
# When AI integration is implemented
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
QDRANT_URL=
QDRANT_API_KEY=
```

## Security Guidelines

### Input Validation

```typescript
// ALWAYS validate with Zod
const userInputSchema = z.object({
  message: z.string().min(1).max(10000),
  userId: z.string().uuid()
});

// Validate before processing
const validated = userInputSchema.parse(rawInput);
```

### API Security

- Use parameterized queries (Convex handles this)
- Implement rate limiting for all endpoints
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Never log sensitive information

## Performance Optimization

### Frontend Optimization

- Use React Server Components by default
- Implement code splitting with dynamic imports
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Use Suspense boundaries for loading states

### Backend Optimization

- Index database queries appropriately
- Implement caching where beneficial
- Use connection pooling (Convex handles this)
- Paginate large result sets

## Directory-Specific Guidelines

### `/apps/web`

- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React Server Components first
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Shadcn UI for components

### `/packages/backend`

- Convex serverless functions
- Type-safe schema definitions
- Real-time subscriptions
- Automatic scaling

**Remember**: The goal is to write code that is maintainable, performant, secure, and follows the established patterns in this codebase. When in doubt, look at existing implementations for guidance.

## Before Writing Code
1. Analyze existing patterns in the codebase
2. Consider edge cases and error scenarios
3. Follow the rules below strictly
4. Validate accessibility requirements

## Rules

### Accessibility (a11y)
- Don't use `accessKey` attribute on any HTML element.
- Don't set `aria-hidden="true"` on focusable elements.
- Don't add ARIA roles, states, and properties to elements that don't support them.
- Don't use distracting elements like `<marquee>` or `<blink>`.
- Only use the `scope` prop on `<th>` elements.
- Don't assign non-interactive ARIA roles to interactive HTML elements.
- Make sure label elements have text content and are associated with an input.
- Don't assign interactive ARIA roles to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't assign `tabIndex` to non-interactive HTML elements.
- Don't use positive integers for `tabIndex` property.

- Accompany `onMouseOver`/`onMouseOut` with `onFocus`/`onBlur`.
- Include caption tracks for audio and video elements.
- Use semantic elements instead of role attributes in JSX.
- Make sure all anchors are valid and navigable.
- Ensure all ARIA properties (`aria-*`) are valid.
- Use valid, non-abstract ARIA roles for elements with ARIA roles.
- Use valid ARIA state and property values.
- Use valid values for the `autocomplete` attribute on input elements.

- Make sure the assertion function, like expect, is placed inside an it() function call.
- Don't use disabled tests.

## Common Tasks

### Using Ultracite for Code Quality

The project uses Ultracite (via Biome) for formatting and linting:

```bash
# Format and fix code automatically
npx ultracite format

# Check for issues without fixing  
npx ultracite lint

# Initialize Ultracite in new projects
npx ultracite init
```

## Example: Error Handling
```typescript
// ✅ Good: Comprehensive error handling
try {
  const result = await fetchData();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  console.error('API call failed:', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}

// ❌ Bad: Swallowing errors
try {
  return await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  console.log(e);
}
```
