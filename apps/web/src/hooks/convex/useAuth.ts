All auth functions are commented out as the required Convex backend functions 
are not yet implemented. To enable these features, add the corresponding functions
to the backend/convex/auth.ts file:

- isTokenBlacklisted
- getUserBlacklistedTokens  
- getAuthStats
- blacklistToken
- storeNonce
- validateAndRemoveNonce
- cleanupExpiredTokens
- cleanupExpiredNonces
*/

// This file is temporarily disabled as the required backend functions are not implemented.
// Uncomment and implement the corresponding Convex functions in backend/convex/auth.ts to use these hooks.
